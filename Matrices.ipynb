    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [vectors](vectors) guide, we were introduced to the concept of vectors—a fundamental primitive of linear algebra. Another equally important primitive is that of a matrix. Similar to vectors, matrices are used everywhere in linear algebra and other areas of mathematics, science, and engineering. Just like the word _vector_ sounds complex (but is nothing more than a list of numbers), a **matrix** is simply a _table_ of numbers that represent something. Matrices look a lot like vectors except they have multiple \"columns\" of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty simple. Looks a lot like a vector. Viewing matrices as tables, we say a matrix has columns and rows. A _column_ in a matrix is a vertical list of numbers (e.g., $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix}$ is the first column in the matrix above). A _row_ in a matrix is a horizontal list of numbers (e.g., $\\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}$ is the second row in the matrix above). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we represented vectors as symbols with an arrow over it (e.g., $\\vec{a}$). Matrices are usually represented with capital letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, sometimes bolded:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the importance of vectors cannot be minimized, I tend to view vectors as something akin to syntactic sugar. What I mean by that is vectors and matrices look _awfully_ similar, don't you think? One might even say that vectors are a specialized type of matrix (a matrix with only a single column). We'll see more of that in a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are an integral part of linear algebra and many other areas and disciplines. Here are a few examples of use cases where matrices are helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Represent the pixels in an image\n",
    "  - Represent the responses to a user survey as the rows in a matrix\n",
    "  - Represent the 3D transformation to move the camera in a video game\n",
    "  - Calculate the properties of an electrical circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "## All sizes and shapes\n",
    "Matrices can come in all sizes and shapes. When describing a matrix, the size (or sometimes called shape) is important. Conventionally, the size is defined as $M x N$ where $M=\\\\#\\ rows$ and $N=\\\\#\\ columns$. Taking the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ is a $2 x 2$ matrix (2 rows, 2 columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$B$ Is a $2 x 3$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C$ is a $3 x 1$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a minute, isn't $C$ a vector? Yes, indeed. A vector is simply a $N x 1$ matrix where $N$ is the number of components. If a vector is just a special type of matrix, logic would dictate that any operation you can do to a vector, you can do to a matrix. And, that logic would be correct (as we'll see later).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Referencing components\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, it's useful to reference specific components in a matrix. For example, if we wanted to reference $-1$ in the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 \\\\ \\textbf{-1} & 2\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that $-1$ lives in the second row and first column, so we can write this as $A_{2,1} = -1$. Generally, we  represent a component of a matrix as $A_{i,j}$ where $i$ is the row number and $j$ is the column number. Let's see how we can represent the rest of the components in the above matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_{1,1} = 1 \\qquad\n",
    "A_{1,2} = 3 \\qquad\n",
    "A_{2,1} = -1 \\qquad\n",
    "A_{2,2} = 2\n",

    "Awesome, let's pause and write some code to see how we can represent a matrix, determine its size, and fetch a component. Because a matrix is simply a table of numbers, the easiest way to represent a matrix in Python is as a list of lists. Note also, since Python is 0-based, the first component in the matrix is at position $(0, 0)$, whereas in our discussion, we were representing the first component as $(1, 1)$."

    "## Operating on matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, vectors are essentially special-case matrices (a matrix with only 1 column). Because of that, vector and matrix operations behave the same way. If needed, you can visit the [vectors](vectors) guide to see more details on how to perform vector operations. Like vector addition/subtraction, matrix addition/subtraction is performed component wise. Similarly, scalar multiplication is performed by multiplying each component by the scalar value. Let's walk through a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",

A matrix that contains a different number of rows and columns is said to be a **rectangular** matrix. Rectangular matrices are usually referenced as $M x N$ where $M$ is the number of rows and $N$ is the number of columns. Fortunately, the matrix operations above work with matrices of any size (whether they are square or rectangular). For example, here is addition of two arbitrary $2 x 4$ matrices:\n",

We start by finding the first column of $C$. The first step is to take the first column of $B$ and use the components in the first column to form a linear combination of _all_ the columns in $A$.

    "## Multiplying different sized matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when doing matrix addition and subtraction, the matrices **must** be the same size (i.e., both must be $MxN$). So far, the examples of matrix multiplication we've seen have all been with matrices of the same size. However, it's possible to multiply different sized matrices. When multiplying $AB$, the only requirement is that the number of columns in $A$ must match the number of rows in $B$. That is, a matrix with size $M x N$ can be multiplied with another matrix of size $N x P$. The size of the resulting matrix will be $M x P$. Thinking about it, it should make sense—since the number of components in the columns of $B$ dictate the combination of the columns of $A$, it makes sense that the number of rows in the result matrix will equal the number of rows in $A$ and the number of columns of the result matrix will equal the number of columns in $B$. There's a useful mental image that you can use when determining if the multiplication is legal and what the result matrix's size will be:\n",

    "This was a dense, but very important guide, so good work making your way through it. In this guide, we introduced the concept of matrices and showed just how similar matrices and vectors are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally, matrices are represented as capital letters and are defined as a table of numbers of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n",
    "a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\dots & a_{m,n}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices have a size that is defined as $M x N$ where $M=\\\\#\\ rows$ and $N=\\\\#\\ columns$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication behave in the same way as vector operations in that they are performed component wise. When performing matrix addition and subtraction, the matrices are required to be the same size:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is an important operation which can be viewed in different ways. A systematic way to view matrix multiplication is element-wise multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & a_2 \\\\ a_3 & a_4\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}b_1 & b_2 \\\\ b_3 & b_4\\end{bmatrix} = \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "_Or_, it can be viewed as a combination of the columns of the left matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & a_2 \\\\ a_3 & a_4\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}b_1 & b_2 \\\\ b_3 & b_4\\end{bmatrix} = \n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to multiply 2 matrices, the number of columns of the left matrix must equal the number of rows of the right matrix. That is, if the left matrix is $M x N$ and the right matrix is $N x P$, the number of columns of the left matrix ($N$) equals the number of rows of the right matrix (also $N$), so the multiplication is valid and the resulting matrix has a size of $M x P$.\n",

    "Getting a grasp on vectors and matrices are a necessary prerequisite for the entirety of linear algebra. They are used extensively throughout, so it's necessary to have a good working basis of what they are and how to work with them. Equipped with this knowledge, we are now ready to tackle the meat of linear algebra. In the next section, we'll begin our exploration of linear systems and finally see how we can use linear algebra to help Harry solve an accounting problem. Let's go help Harry. On to [linear systems](linear-systems)!"
