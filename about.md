Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this guide on _{{ site.title }}_. Thanks for taking the time to check it out.

The insipiration for this guide is multi-faceted. First, a lot of resources on linear algebra tend to be very academic in nature. As a result, some people that
want to get an handle on the concepts without dealing with unnecessary complexities are demotivated to continue. Second, linear algebra is a super interesting
subfield of math that is used all throughout all areas of math, science, engineering, and industry in general (it's used heavily in machine learning and AI, which
initially sparked my interest in revisiting it). Last, by trying to verbalize and communicate the concepts, I find it actually helps me in better understanding the
concepts.

These guides are all written as Jupyter Notebooks and published on Github. Feel free to fork the repository, send a pull request, or create any issues. The repository
for the guides can be found at <{{ site.github_repo }}>.

I've tried to do my best to provide sufficient details and examples. If you find issues in the content or anything isn't clear, or just have suggestions in general,
feel free to let me let me know. You can reach me by email at <{{ site.email }}>. Thanks!
