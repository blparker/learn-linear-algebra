    "\n",
    "In earlier guides, we were introduced to [vectors](vectors) and [matrices](matrices) and have learned how to work with them. These are proving useful because we showed in the [linear systems](linear-systems) guide that we can represent a system of linear equations as matrices and vectors. This wouldn't be all that useful if we couldn't do anything with it. The benefit of representing systems of linear equations this way is that it allows us to perform matrix and vector operations easily to arrive at the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this knowledge, we are now equipped to help solve Harry's system using matrices. We introduced Harry's problem in the [linear systems](linear-systems) guide. Harry has a problem that he needs our help in solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Harry recently set up shop at a baseball game. Things went well, but at the end of the day, Harry realizes that he didn't keep track of how many individual hotdogs and hamburgers he sold, but he does have totals. He realizes that he sold of a combined total of 50 hotdogs and hamburgers and he made \\\\$85.00 total. Harry sells the hotdogs for \\\\$1.50 and the hamburgers for \\\\$2.00. In order to restock, Harry would like to know how many hotdogs and hamburgers he individually sold.\n",

    "d + h = 50 \\\\[3pt]\n",
    "1.5d + 2h = 85\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [matrices](matrices) guide we showed that you can represent Harry's system of linear equations using matricesâ€”we put the coefficients into a matrix called $A$, the unknown variables into a vector called $\\vec{x}$, and the constants to the right of the equals sign into a vector called $\\vec{b}$:\n",

To find the solutions, we revisit elimination and show how we can apply it systematically to a matrix to find $d$ and $h$.

    "## Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the goal of elimination is to repeatedly do a bunch of operations on the equations until we're left with an equation that has only one variable in it (hence we eliminated all the other variables in that equation). We can then solve for that variable and then _back-substitute_ into the other equations. For matrices, the elimination is done by performing operations on the rows of the matrix. The types of operations that we're allowed to perform on the rows are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Swapping two rows\n",
    "2. Multiplying a row by a nonzero number\n",
    "3. Adding (or subtracting) a multiple of one row to another row\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform these row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros. Let's see how we can do elimination on the coefficients matrix $A$ above. Our starting matrix is essentially $A$, but with a little twist:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[\\begin{array}{@{}cc|c@{}}\n",
    "1 & 1 & 50 \\\\\n",
    "1.5 & 2 & 85\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that in addition to the coefficients, we've added a vertical line and the components of $\\vec{b}$ to the matrix as well. A matrix in this form is called an **augmented matrix** because we've augmented the coefficients matrix by adding the constants from $\\vec{b}$ to it. The reason we do this is because when we do something to one side of an equation, we have to do it the other side as well. When performing the row operations on the matrix, we need to make sure that we do it to both sides. Creating the augmented matrix isn't absolutely necessary, but if you don't, you need to ensure that whatever operations you perform on $A$, you perform on $\\vec{b}$ as well. With an augmented matrix, it happens in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's systematically work through trying to eliminate the values in the matrix. We perform elimination on a row-by-row basis by starting with the first row and working our way down. Per row, our goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the **pivot** in the row. The pivot is the first non-zero element in the row.\n",
    "2. Use row operations to get all zeros below the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will become clearer as we walk through an example. Revisiting our augmented matrix from above, we start with  the first row and find the pivot:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first non-zero element in the first row is $1$ in position $A_{1,1}$. Our goal now is to get all zeros in the column below the pivot. Since our matrix has only 2 rows, we just need to get a zero in $A_{2,1}$. What operation can we perform on the second row to turn that $1.5$ into $0$? If we cycle through our rules above, there are no other rows to swap with to get a $0$ there, and also no nonzero number we can multiply the second row with to get a 0 there. However, since we're trying to get a $0$ in $A_{2,1}$, we can subtract some multiple of the first row from the second row. What is that multiplier? Since $A_{2,1}$ is $1.5$ and $A_{1,1}$ is $1$, we can simply multiply the first row by $1.5$ and subtract that from the second row, replacing the second row. Note, we aren't actually changing the coefficients of the first row, we're just subtracting some multiple of it from the second row. Below, we're performing that row operation and we're left with a modified version of $A$, which has all zeros below the pivot:\n",

In the example above, $R2 = R2 - 1.5*R1$ can be interpreted as: subtract from row 2, $1.5$ times row 1 and replace row 2. Moving on, if we had a third row, the next step would be get a $0$ in the $A_{3,1}$ position, but since we only have 2 rows, we're done with the first row. Our next step is to move to the second row of this modified matrix and identify the pivot. The first non-zero element in the modified matrix is $0.5$. Next, we need to get zeros in all the elements below the pivot, but since there are no more rows below, we're done with elimination.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we know $h$, we can begin working our way back up the equations and plug in our solutions for the known variables and solving for the other variables. This step is called _back-substitution_. Knowing $h$, we back-substitute $h$ into the first equation and solve for $d$:\n",

An augmented matrix is simply the coefficient matrix with the components of $\\vec{b}$ tacked on to the end. The reason we do this is so that when we perform row operations on the matrix, we perform them to both sides of the equation.\n",

Per row, the first step is to find the pivot and perform a series of row operations such that all the components below the pivot are zero. After elimination has been done on the matrix, the last equation (usually) contains one non-zero variable. This allows us to solve for that one variable, and then begin working our way upwards substituting in the variables we've solved for. This process, known as _back-substitution_ will yield all the components of $\\vec{x}$."
