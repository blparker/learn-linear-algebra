These operations will prove useful because it was shown in the [linear systems](linear-systems) guide that we can represent a system of linear equations as matrices and vectors. This wouldn't be all that useful if we couldn't do anything with it. The benefit of representing systems of linear equations this way is that it allows us to perform matrix and vector operations easily to arrive at the solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of elimination is to systematically eliminate variables of a system of linear equations by performing operations until we're left with an equation that only has one variable in it (hence we eliminated all the other variables in that equation). We can then solve for that variable and then _back-substitute_ into the other equations to find the values of other variables. For matrices, elimination is done by performing operations on the rows of the matrix. The types of operations that we're allowed to perform are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Swapping two rows\n",
    "2. Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar number\n",
    "3. Adding (or subtracting) a multiple of one row to another row\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform these row operations modifying the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros. Given the matrix $A$ from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 1.5 & 2\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to perform operations until we arrive at a matrix that resembles the following (note, the `*` is a placeholder for a number):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}* & * \\\\ 0 & *\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing so, the last row represents an equation with only one variable that we can easily solve for. The steps for elimination are pretty straightforward: we start with the first row, and repeat the following 2 steps for all rows or until the matrix has all zeros in the bottom left corner:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Find the first non-zero element in the row. This element is called the **pivot**\n",
    "  2. Use one of the above row operations to get all zeros below the pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing row operations, we need to be careful that the operations are performed to both sides of the equation. In other words, when performing an operation to a row of $A$, we need to ensure the same operation is performed to the corresponding component of $\\vec{b}$. Let's see how we can do elimination on the matrix $A$ above:\n",

The next step is to use a row operation to turn all components below the pivot into $0$. Since $A$ has only 2 rows, we just need to turn $1.5$ in position $A_{2,1}$ into $0$.

Remember, anything we do to a row of $A$, we need to also do to the corresponding component of $\\vec{b}$. So, let's also multiply the first component of $\\vec{b}$ by $1.5$:\n",
